<h1 style="color:black;text-align:center;">What are my Hobbies?</h1>

<p style="color:white;text-align:center;">This project is done with Notepad++, HTML, and a bit of JavaScript. This is my first time using JavaScript. Finally, I used GitHub to host this.</p>

<p id="1st" style="display:none;text-align:center;">I am a Programmer, I am learning Java on my own and hopefully I will learn more Python programming than I have taught myself at school. I also have not worked with HTML nor CSS for a few months, so I forgot the syntax and my design isn't that great.</p>
<p id ="2nd" style="display:none;text-align:center;">I am a Casual Gamer, I play free Steam games, Browser games, and I have been playing Civilization 6.</p>
